Common practices are mandatory in  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and while providers in England may choose to work towards  them, they are not required to do so as these are not regulatory requirements and will not be  assessed as part of the OfS™s regulatory framework. National regulators and QAA are not bound by the  information in this advice and guidance and will not view it as containing indicators of compliance.   This guidance does not interpret statutory requirements. Terminology Doctoral degrees:  Doctoral degrees are qualifications rooted in original research - the creation of new  knowledge or originality in the application of knowledge. The doctorate is, therefore, unique in the  array of qualifications offered by higher education providers. Other key reference points for doctoral  degrees are the doctoral qualification descriptors included in the national higher education qualification  frameworks for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and for Scotland, and the QAA  Doctoral Degree  Characteristics Statement  (2015).  Masters by research:  Research master™s degrees and doctorates are closely linked because of the  emphasis in both on independent research. Research students may choose to register for a research  master™s degree either as a standalone research qualification or as an entry qualification for a doctorate.  The QAA  Master™s Degree Characteristics Statement  (2015) summarises the main features of research  master™s degrees, including a general description of the characteristics relevant to research   master™s degrees. Research students:  The higher education sector recognises the diverse needs of research students and  aims to encourage consistency of provision for all students, regardless of background or circumstances.  The Expectations and Core and Common practices are therefore intended to apply to the many  different types of students undertaking UK research degrees. These include full and part-time students,  UK and international students, students from all backgrounds, and those with a range of protected  characteristics and prior educational experience.  Graduate schools:  Within the UK, research students are often part of a cohort. As well as having a  subject identity, they may belong to a graduate school and/or doctoral training centre. Doctoral training  centres and other arrangements where higher education providers work together, help to shape the way  that many doctoral students are trained. Codes of practice:  Codes of practice for research degrees help both prospective and current research  students and staff to know what their responsibilities are and what they can expect from one another.  All codes and related guidance are written clearly for, and are accessible to, those who need to  use them and contain sufficient information for all intended users, including any externally located  supervisors.UK Quality Code - Advice and Guidance  Research Degrees \n"
